            </h3>
            <p>
                When you first create your account on the PokeGuild you will be asked to join three different guilds, the fire, water and grass guilds and create a username and 
                password like other platforms. The type you choose will help place you in groups for the different versions of Pokemon you enjoy.

            </h3>
            <p>
                From your guild you will be able to join any group you want to be apart of based on what form of Pokemon you enjoy. The different groups would be based on the Pokemon
                card trading game, casual video game players, competitive video game players, Pokemon anime fans, and groups for other side and fan Pokemon games.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The main goal of this platform is help the fans of the Pokemon franchise make friends. After collaborating with people in your guild and groups, you will be able to
                add them as friends in the app. Becoming friends with others opens up the opportunity to personally message them and make your own PokeGuild servers to enjoy!
